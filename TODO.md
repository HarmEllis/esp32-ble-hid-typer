[x] The PWA is missing the back button on all pages except the flash page.
[x] The wifi functionality should not be visible or implemented anywhere, but is visible in the PWA provisioning flow.
[x] Why can you change settings in the PWA while not connected to the ESP? Should the settings not only be accesible via the Send text page? 
[x] Add a backspace, del and enter key button to the Send text page and create a default collapsed part on the page in which there are shortkeys like ctrl+alt+F1, ctrl+alt+F2 etc...
[x] I would like to see if the esp is connected as an keyboard or not and prevent sending text when not connected
[x] the Typing status does not revert in the PWA when typing is finished
[x] Move the Settings button to the left of the Disconnect button
[x] Change the 'Set Up New Device' button and the 'Flas firmware' button so they are smaller and next to each other with a combined with that is equal to the 'Connect to Device' button
[x] The back button on the settings page takes you back to the home page instead of the Sent text page; this is also for the 'Change PIN' and 'Audit log' page (maybe use the browser history api?)
[x] Add left and right arrow buttons and home and end buttons next to the Enter button
[x] Add ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+v and ctrl+enter to the shortcuts
[x] Add a virtual keyboard (default hidden like the shortcuts) to the pwa (that also works good on a mobile phone); Use an existing npm package if that will give the best result.
[x] The abort button should only be usable when typing
[x] The Send, Paste & Send and Abort buttons have different heights, fix this
[x] Add a toggle for the keyboard to switch between the simple layout and a full layout.
[x] The small keyboard has {left} and {right} instead of arrow left and right icons like the full keyboard, fix this
[x] Enable SysRq commands (advanced) does not show the collapsed SysRq commands section, I expected them below shortcuts
[x] Wait with applying setting changes until mouse up event to prevent a laggy ux
[x] While typing the 'Keyboard not mounted' message is shown while I can see it is typing correctly; when finished typing the keyboard is ready again
[x] Rename 'Keyboard not mounted' to 'Not connected to device as keyboard'
[x] Show what action which SysRq commands send (with the key combination wrapped in parentheses if that is important info for a sys admin)
