[x] The PWA is missing the back button on all pages except the flash page.
[x] The wifi functionality should not be visible or implemented anywhere, but is visible in the PWA provisioning flow.
[ ] Why can you change settings in the PWA while not connected to the ESP? Should the settings not only be accesible via the Send text page? 
[ ] Add a backspace, del and enter key button to the Send text page and create a default collapsed part on the page in which there are shortkeys like ctrl+alt+F1, ctrl+alt+F2 etc...
[ ] I would like to see if the esp is connected as an keyboard or not and prevent sending text when not connected
[ ] the Typing status does not revert in the PWA when typing is finished
